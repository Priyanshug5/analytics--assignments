The Art of Analytics: Exploring Value from Data
Overview
Welcome to the "Art of Analytics" GitHub repository! This repository houses the files and resources related to a data science project carried out under the auspices of the Society of Civil Engineers during the summer. The project's primary goal was to leverage analytics techniques to gain deeper insights and enhance decision-making processes within the realm of civil engineering.

Project Description
The "Art of Analytics" project ventured into the field of data science to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights from a variety of datasets. The project encompassed several key areas of analytics, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and visualization.

Objectives
Data Exploration: Perform a thorough exploration of civil engineering-related datasets to uncover patterns, anomalies, and outliers.
Analysis Techniques: Utilize a range of data science and analytics techniques to extract actionable insights from the data.
Visualization: Develop informative and visually compelling charts, graphs, and dashboards to effectively communicate findings.
Impact Assessment: Assess the potential influence of analytics-driven insights on decision-making processes within civil engineering.
Project Highlights
Housing Prices Analysis: Employed linear regression models to predict housing prices based on various features.
Wine Quality Assessment: Analyzed and predicted wine quality using Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes and random forest models.
IPL Match Statistics Exploration: Conducted in-depth analysis of IPL match data, uncovering key trends and patterns through data manipulation and visualization.
Titanic Survivor Prediction: Developed predictive models for Titanic survivor data, utilizing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning techniques.
